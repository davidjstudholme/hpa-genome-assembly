Dear David Studholme,

We have received your genome submission for:

SUBID     	BioProject	BioSample	Organism
---------------------------------------------------
SUB15470957	PRJNA298674	SAMN50023145	Sphingobium limneticum Hpa-799

We compared the size of this genome assembly to those of 
similarly taxonomically ranked organisms in GenBank and 
NCBI's Assembly database, as described at 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/help/genome-size-check/ . 
The genome size of your submission falls outside of the expected 
size range for the organism specified in your submission.

If there is a problem with the assembly, please correct the assembly
and resubmit.  If this assembly inadvertently contains more than one
organism, you may need to create a new assembly using DNA isolated
from a fresh culture that is not contaminated.

Alternatively, is there some reason the genome for this organism is
expected to fail this test and be a different size from similar 
organisms? If there is only one example for this species in GenBank,
please provide the expected size for this organism. Send your 
explanation to: genomes@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

The size check is automatically run on every resubmission, so you 
should ignore this error if you have already explained why this 
genome failed the test.


NOTE: The genome submission portal should only be used for eukaryotic 
or prokaryotic genome assemblies.  Submissions for individual genes
(eg, 16S rRNA),  microsatellites, phage, viruses, or organelle-only 
assemblies should be submitted using the appropriate non-genome option 
at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/
