[] We ran your sequences through our Contamination Screen. The screen found 
sequences that need to be trimmed and/or excluded. More details about the 
contamination screening process are available at https://github.com/ncbi/fcs

We were able to remove sequences marked to exclude and/or trimmed contamination 
from the ends of sequence (see the FixedForeignContaminations.txt file). If the 
contamination is on either side of a run of N's, the N's were also removed.
We have uploaded the modified fasta file ForeignContaminationModified.zip to the 
submission portal.

However, we could not remove the contamination in the RemainingContamination.txt file.  
We cannot remove contamination that is in the middle of a sequence. The sequence may need
to be split at the contamination and the sequence on either side of the contamination submitted 
as a separate sequence. In addition, we do not automatically remove mitochondrial 
sequences in eukaryotic submissions. 

Please adjust these remaining sequences appropriately and then resubmit.  After you 
remove the contamination, trim any Ns at the ends of the sequence and remove any sequences 
that are shorter than 200 nt and not part of a multi-component scaffold.

WARNING: If we do not hear from you by $(add.days,30), your 
submission will be deleted from the processing queue.

Note that mismatches between the name of the adaptor/primer identified in the screen 
and the sequencing technology used to generate the sequencing data should not be used 
to discount the validity of the screen results as the adaptors/primers of many 
different sequencing platforms share sequence similarity.


Mitochondrion:
[] Some sequences are similar to a mitochondrial sequence. There are two options:
 (A) If you are not sequencing mitochondrial DNA, remove these sequences
 (B) If you want to include the mitochondrial sequences in the genome submission, 
 label them as mitochondrial. 
- To label the sequences in a BATCH submission, add a source qualifier in the fasta  
 definition line [location=mitochondrion].  See "IMPORTANT: Additional requirements 
 for batch submissions" at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomesubmit/#batch_assignment
- If this is not a BATCH submission, indicate that these sequences are mitochondrial in the 
 Assignment tab of the submission portal.
- In addition, it is recommended but not required that you move these sequences to the end 
of your submission or put them in a separate file so that they are clustered together.



The contamination that we could not automatically remove is listed below.
You will need to adjust these sequences and resubmit:
