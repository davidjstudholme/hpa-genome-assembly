Dear David Studholme,

We have received your genome submission for:

SUBID     	BioProject	BioSample	Accession	Organism
---------------------------------------------------
SUB15470772	PRJNA298674	SAMN04161522	LLKM00000000   	Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis Noks1

We compared the size of this genome assembly to those of 
similarly taxonomically ranked organisms in GenBank and 
NCBI's Assembly database, as described at 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/help/genome-size-check/ . 
The genome size of your submission falls outside of the expected 
size range for the organism specified in your submission.

If there is a problem with the assembly, please correct the assembly
and resubmit.  If this assembly inadvertently contains more than one
organism, you may need to create a new assembly using DNA isolated
from a fresh culture that is not contaminated.

Alternatively, is there some reason the genome for this organism is
expected to fail this test and be a different size from similar 
organisms? If there is only one example for this species in GenBank,
please provide the expected size for this organism. Send your 
explanation to: genomes@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

The size check is automatically run on every resubmission, so you 
should ignore this error if you have already explained why this 
genome failed the test.


NOTE: The genome submission portal should only be used for eukaryotic 
or prokaryotic genome assemblies.  Submissions for individual genes
(eg, 16S rRNA),  microsatellites, phage, viruses, or organelle-only 
assemblies should be submitted using the appropriate non-genome option 
at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/
